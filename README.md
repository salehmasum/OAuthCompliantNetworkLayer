A swift HttpClient that will deal with OAuth2.0 compliant server in this case Spotify

## Description 

The Swift project in question involves the development of an HTTP client that is designed to interact with OAuth 2.0 compliant servers, particularly that of Spotify in this instance. 

OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that lets your app request authorization to private details in a user's Spotify account without getting their password. 

The client uses Swift, a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS that provides modern language features like closures, generics, type inference, etc., for efficient app performance.

This HttpClient successfully manages the access tokens required for OAuth 2.0 Spotify authentication. It supports authorization code flow, which involves receiving an authorization token from Spotifyâ€™s Authorization Endpoint and exchanging it for access tokens. 

The client also includes mechanisms for token refresh to maintain a seamless user experience. Its designed to ensure efficiency, data integrity and information security throughout the authorization process, to grant the app access to Spotify resources in a safe manner.
